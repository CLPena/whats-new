## Travel Tracker

#### Abstract
This is the first solo project from Mod 3 at Turing School of Software and Design. We were given a spec detailing a news app where a user can click through news categories and search for a keyword within the headlines of articles from that category. The interaction of this app is fairly basic because the learning goal was to learn the fundamentals of React.

#### Project Next Steps
I would love to further finesse the layout of this to be more modern and responsive. I'd also like to explore the last extension of the project, using fetch to pull from an external database of articles instead of just the dataset provided. I would also like to add more visual interest, like icons, photo galleries, videos, etc. 

#### Setup
